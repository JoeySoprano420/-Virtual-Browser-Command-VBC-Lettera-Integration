✉️ Contributing to VBC
Thank you for stepping into the scrollspace. 🖋️ Virtual Browser Command (VBC) is a styled, living execution shell that speaks in letters—fusing command line, VM, and browser into one ceremonial environment. We welcome contributions across all layers: bug reports, feature glyphs, documentation scrolls, and pull requests.
