🔒 VBC Security Scroll
📌 Supported Versions
We actively maintain and patch the following versions of the Virtual Browser Command (VBC):

Version	Support Status
v1.x.x	✅ Fully Supported
< v1.0.0	❌ Deprecated
Older versions may lack sealing protocols, sandbox integrity, or correspondence validation. We encourage all contributors to operate within the latest sealed envelope.

🧭 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you uncover a vulnerability within VBC’s shell, compiler, or execution overlays:

Do not publicly disclose the issue. Ritual integrity must be preserved until the scroll is sealed.

Submit a private report via GitHub Security Advisories: 👉 VBC Security Advisories

Alternatively, you may contact the maintainers through the issues option.

All reports are treated with discretion and ceremonial care. We honor those who help preserve the sanctity of the shell.

Together, we ensure VBC remains a secure, styled, and self-healing execution environment—where every glyph is sealed, and every scroll is safe. 🖋️
